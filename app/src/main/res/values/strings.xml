        Build your first website from scratch and actually have fun doing it.
        This book walks you through the process, teaching you everything you need to know along the way.
        Plus we throw in lots of silly jokes and zombie references to keep you entertained and engaged.
        Learning doesn’t have to bore you to death (because then you might come back as a zombie and
        it’d just be messy).</string>
